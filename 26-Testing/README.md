# 26 Testing

## Difference between Manual Testing and Automated testing

- Manual: during the development, we ensure the output obtained behaves the way it is intended. Hard to test in all scenarios.
- Automated: a specific pice of code is created to automatically test parts of the applications or even a complete process.

## Types of Automated test

- Unit Tests: Individual buildings block (functions, components, etc) in isolation. There are several Unit tests in a project.
- Integration Tests: Combination of multiple blocks. A project contains a few of them.
- End-to-en (e2e) test: Entire scenarios, much more complex. A project contains just a couple of them.

### What to test?

Test different building blocks. Unit Tests are essential since we are testing the smallest blocks that make up our application.

### How to test?

Test different type of scenarios: success, error and rare (but possible) cases.

## Tools

- Jest: Tool for running tests and asserting results.
- React Testing library: Tool to simulate (render) the React application/components.
